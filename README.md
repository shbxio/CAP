Climate Action Plan

This project is a unique open-source initiative focused on creating a Climate Action Plan using Power BI, the Power Platform, and Microsoft Sustainability Manager. It's not just a project, but a mission to leverage technology for the betterment of our environment.

The Climate Action Plan provided here is available for download and can be used for your own purposes. It serves as a click-through demo to understand how the different components work together, or it can be used as a foundation for your own environmental initiatives. This project is an excellent opportunity to explore the capabilities of these tools in the context of sustainability and climate action.

This project is a work in progress, and I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions for improvement. Anyone interested in using technology for climate action is invited to participate.

I hope this project inspires and motivates you to explore and develop your own ideas for climate action. Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference. Let's work together to create a more sustainable and efficient world.

Thank you for visiting and supporting this project. Together, we can make a significant impact on our environment. Let's create a greener future together!
